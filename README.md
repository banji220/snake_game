Hey guys
This is my first game making with Python
As a junior dev I think fun and interesting project could be really cool to do!
In this project I'll  make a snake with food(in random Places) and we'll make borders around our windows .
After that we'll learn how to write if statement if snake head touches his/her body or segments!
So let's dive in our code and learn something new.
Happy Coding ;)
